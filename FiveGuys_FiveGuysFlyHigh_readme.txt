[How to Play && Technology] 

How to play:  

Overall, AWSD controls the main character's movements. Press the SPACE key to jump, hold down SHIFT key to speed up. Mouse moving to control the camera view. Press ESC to turn on/off in the game menu, where you can pause, restart and quit. You can also be promoted to previous/next level when you really get stuck, but for complete game experience, skipping levels is not recommended. 

For level forest, the player needs to collect 15 cherries to move on. 

For level illusion, the player needs to solve some puzzles as hinted in the environment. 

For level butterfly, the player needs to catch all five butterflies and go through the stone arch.  

For level of the Winter Olympic game, press “k” to get on board and “L” back to walking mode, hold down shift key to sneak without alerting the chasing monster. Keep pressing “k” to switch between the farther camera view and closer camera view. 

For level lava, the lava is lethal and keeps increasing. The player needs to collect the floating ice cubes to gain enough time to escape the room.   

Technology: 

Forest Level: The player could explore the forest and collect berries by walking through and jumping over the obstacles.  

Illusion Level: Iteration, recursion for fractal objects, modeling and morphing via math formulas, shader rendering for tele-portal, explosion force built in Unity engine 

ButterFly Level: The AI technology requirement is implemented here; each butterfly is controlled by a NavMeshAgent and traverses the game level as a NavMesh terrain.  

SnowBoard Level: State-driven camera, 2 animation group (normal walking/jumping/falling/falling_from_high/landing and skiing mode), snow event (partial effect),autogenerated mesh via connecting vector 3 vertices (for further implementation) 

Lava Level: Item will randomly drop lava level or extend remaining time.


[Known Problem Areas]  

All major bugs are fixed when testing.  
In level Olympics, when switch from snowboarding to walking, the main character may rotate. 
Some UI may not perfectly align depends on your device resolution.
